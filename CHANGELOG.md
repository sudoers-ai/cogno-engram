## 0.1.1 — 2026-08-02

Maintenance ops for an embedding-model switch.

- `reembed_knowledge_nodes`: only `memories` had a re-embed op, so a graph node
  left in the old vector space became silently unreachable by
  `find_nodes_by_embedding` — re-embedding one store and not the other left the
  system half-migrated in a way nothing reported.
- Both re-embed ops now prefer the embedder's `embed_batch` when it offers one,
  falling back to sequential `embed`. Re-embedding is the bulk operation by
  definition, and against a metered provider the difference is latency and
  rate-limit headroom.
